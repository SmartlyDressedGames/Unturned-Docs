GUID
====

Globally Unique Identifiers (**GUID**s) are 32 hexadecimal digits used to identify assets. They are preferable to file names because the files can be moved without redirectors.

At the time of writing a useful tool for generating GUIDs is: https://www.guidgenerator.com/

Legacy ids are 16 bits with a [0, 65535] range, whereas GUIDs are 128 bits with an unimaginably huge range. This allows them to be generated without coordination or registration between developers.
