Gear Assets
===========

Clothing gear can be worn by players and zombies. The inherited Hair_Visible and Beard_Visible properties default to the gear asset's corresponding Hair and Beard flag properties.

This inherits the [ClothingAsset](/ItemAsset/ClothingAsset.md) class.

Gear Asset Properties
---------------------

**Hair** *flag*: Specified if hair should be visible.

**Beard** *flag*: Specified if facial hair should be visible.

**Hair_Override** *string*: Path to the model that should use the player's hair color.
