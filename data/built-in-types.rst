C# Built-in Types
=================

Placeholder article describing built-in C# types. Probably linking to Microsoft's documentation as well, here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/built-in-types.

   * - C# type
     - Alias(es)
     - Example Values
     - Default Value
   * - bool
     - Boolean
     - ``false``, ``true``
     - ``false``
   * - byte
     - uint8
     - ``0``, ``128``, ``255``
     - ``0``
   * - float
     - single
     - ``-0.117``, ``12.3``, ``34028``
     - ``0``

.. attention::

    We could create a doc per built-in type, but I don't believe it's necessary. I think a single doc for them *should* be fine for readers, assuming we don't do anything weird.
