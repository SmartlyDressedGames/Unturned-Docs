Steam Workshop
==============

The **Steam Workshop** allows for sharing user-generated content (such as new maps, items, localizations, and other in-game content). This type of content is typically known as a *mod*, or *modification*. Players can download mods by clicking the Subscribe button on the detail page for the item.

Players can start exploring the Steam Workshop from its `Home page <https://steamcommunity.com/app/304930/workshop/>`_, or learn more about the features utilized by *Unturned* from the `About page <https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/about/?appid=304930>`_.

Browsing
--------

There are several tabs and additional filters in the Steam Workshop, to help players find the type of user-generated content they are interested in.

Content under the `Mods <https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=304930&section=readytouseitems>`_ tab can be downloaded by clicking the "Subscribe" button. This content will then be available the next time you launch the game. Some mods may conflict with each other, or may not be compatible with the latest version of the game. We recommend reading the description for each mod you are interested in, in case the mod author has included helpful information.

Content under the `Stockpile Submissions <https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=304930&section=mtxitems>`_ tab cannot be downloaded. Instead, we may incorporate some of these submissions—such as new skins or cosmetics—into the actual game. Players can vote on whether they would like to see a specific submission added into the game. Accepted items may be made available for purchase, or otherwise be unlockable within the game.

The `Collections <https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=304930&section=collections>`_ tab contains groups of mods, which can be quickly and easily downloaded together. These are sometimes referred to as *modpacks*. For example, you may find a collection that adds several medieval-themed mods that are all compatible with each other.

Creating Mods
-------------

Refer to ":ref:`doc_getting_started`" for more information about what tools are needed to create mods. Afterwards, documentation for individual types of content can be found later on in the documentation.

Publishing Mods
---------------

When you are ready to publish your mod, launch the game and navigate to Workshop tab of the main menu. Click the "Submit" button to begin the submission process.

You will see the following fields when attempting to publish a mod:

#. | **Name** – This will be displayed in the Steam Workshop, and some other locations, as the name of your mod.

#. | **Collection Path** – Specify a valid file path to a folder containing your mod. For example, to upload a map you would copy your map's folder into a new folder, and then provide the path to that new folder in this field.

#. | **Preview Image** – Specify a valid path to a .PNG or .JPG file, which will be used as the preview image for your mod. This is displayed in the Steam Workshop, and some other locations.

#. | **Change Note** – This is an optional field. When a change note is included, that text will be added to the "Change Notes" tab of your mod's Workshop page. We recommend using this field when updating your mod.

#. | **Asset Type** – Choose what type of mod you are uploading. Players will be able to filter for your mod based on its asset type. Some options have "sub-types", such as the specific item a skin is intended for.

#. | **Visibility** – This defines who can view your mod once it has been published. You will usually set this to "Public", so that other players can see and download your mod. Although the other options can be helpful if you want to make a few changes before making the mod public.

#. | **Allowed IPs** – This is an optional field. By including an IP address in this field, only the servers with that IP address will be able to automatically download and update the mod via the WorkshopDownloadConfig.json file available to dedicated servers. It is unlikely that you will want to use this field.

#. | **Workshop Section** – Choose which section this mod should be published under. "Ready-to-Use" should be used for mods that other players can immediately download and enjoy. "Curated" should be used for skins or cosmetics that other players can vote on, and we may choose to incorporate into the game.

Before you can publish any mods, you must have accepted the `Steam Subscriber Agreement and Supplemental Workshop Terms <https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/workshoplegalagreement/?appid=304930>`_. If you have agreed to those terms, you will now be able to click the "Create" button and publish your mod.

Updating Mods
-------------

Mods can be updated from the same interface used for publishing mods.

Fill in the fields similar to before. We recommend including information about your update in the "Change Note" field. Note that the "Name" and "Preview Image" fields can be left blank while updating, which will leave them unchanged.

Once the fields have been filled out, select an existing upload from the list of your published mods at the bottom. Your mod will begin updating.
