Vehicle Redirector Assets
=========================

**Vehicle Redirector Assets** help consolidate legacy colored vehicle variants into a single vehicle asset.

Prior to the addition of paintable vehicles, it was common to create duplicates of a vehicle asset with the color being the only difference. One of many downsides with this approach was the increased hassle of keeping changes consistent between all of the variants; for example, when tuning physics.

Vehicle redirector assets ensure compatibility with existing saves and content while merging colored vehicle variants into one unified asset.
