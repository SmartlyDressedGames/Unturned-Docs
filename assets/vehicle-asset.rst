Vehicle Assets
==============

**GUID** *32-digit hexadecimal*: Refer to :ref:`GUID <doc_data_guid>` documentation.

**Type** *enum* (``Vehicle``)

**Rarity** *enum* (``Common``, ``Uncommon``, ``Rare``, ``Epic``, ``Legendary``, ``Mythical``): Rarity of the vehicle, as text shown in menus and colors used for highlights. Defaults to ``Common`` rarity.

**Engine** *enum* (``Blimp``, ``Boat``, ``Car``, ``Helicopter``, ``Plane``, ``Train``): Defaults to ``Car``. Some properties will only be usable depending on the ``Engine`` enumerator used, or may behave differently.

**ID** *uint16*: Must be a unique identifier.

Vehicle Properties
------------------

**Bicycle** *flag*: Player character should use a bicycling animation.

**Bicycle_Anim_Speed** *float*: Multiplier on the speed of the bicycling animation.

**Buildable_Placement_Rule** *enum* (``None``, ``AlwaysAllow``, ``Block``): Overrides how barricades can be attached to the vehicle. Defaults to ``None``, i.e., no override.

  - ``None``: Vehicle does not override placement. This means, by default, that barricades can be placed on the vehicle unless the barricade sets ``Allow_Placement_On_Vehicle`` to false. (e.g., beds and sentry guns) Note that gameplay config ``Bypass_Buildable_Mobility``, if true, takes priority.
  - ``AlwaysAllow``: Vehicle allows any barricade to be placed on it, regardless of the barricade's ``Allow_Placement_On_Vehicle`` setting. The legacy option for this was the ``Supports_Mobile_Buildables`` flag. Vanilla trains originally used this option, but it was exploited to move beds into tunnel walls.
  - ``Block``: Vehicle prevents any barricade from being placed on it. Note that gameplay config ``Bypass_Buildable_Mobility``, if true, takes priority.

**Bypass_Hash_Verification** *flag*: Disable hash verification check, and allow for mismatched files.

**Bypass_ID_Limit** *flag*: Allows for using an ``ID`` value within the range reserved for official content.

**Cam_Driver_Offset** *float*: The vertical offset for the driver's first-person camera, in meters. This is additive with the value of ``Cam_Passenger_Offset``.

**Has_Clip_Prefab** *bool*: Whether or not the vehicle has a Clip.prefab. If the vehicle should use the same prefab on the server as on the client, set to false. For example, most official content uses ``Has_Clip_Prefab false``. Defaults to true.

**Has_Horn** *bool*: Whether or not the vehicle should have a horn. Defaults to true when the vehicle either has a ``Horn`` AudioClip, or the ``HornAudioClip`` property has been set to a valid path. Otherwise, defaults to false.

**HornAudioClip** :ref:`Master Bundle Pointer <doc_data_masterbundleptr>`: AudioClip to play when using the horn.

**IgnitionAudioClip** :ref:`Master Bundle Pointer <doc_data_masterbundleptr>`: AudioClip to play when after entering the driver's seat.

**LockMouse** *flag*: First-person camera movement is locked while driving. This is useful for ``Engine Plane`` and ``Engine Helicopter``, as a player's mouse movement while in first-person can be used to steer the vehicle.

**Num_Steering_Tires** *int32*: *This property is deprecated.* Total number of tires that should turn when steering. Defaults to 2 when using ``Engine Car``, to 1 when using any other ``Engine`` enumerator, or to 0 if the ``Crawler`` property has been set.

.. note:: Replaced by the ``WheelConfigurations`` propery.

.. deprecated:: 3.23.4.0

**Reclined** *flag*: Player character should use a reclined idle animation.

**Should_Spawn_Seat_Capsules** *bool*: If true, capsule colliders will be attached to the ``Seat`` GameObject in order to prevent players from clipping into the ground. This is useful for vehicles that do not have a roof. Defaults to false.

**Steering_Tire_#** *int32*: *This property is deprecated.* Set a ``Wheel_#`` GameObject as a steering tire, which will visibly turn when steering. By default, a number of steering tires equal to the value of ``Num_Steering_Tires`` will be automatically set. These will start at ``Steering_Tire_0 0`` (corresponding to ``Wheel_0``), and increment upwards.

.. note:: Replaced by the ``WheelConfigurations`` propery.

**Trunk_Storage_Y** *byte*: Number of rows (vertical storage space). Defaults to 0.

**Valid_Speed_Down** *float*: Configuring this will override the sanity check for reversing speed, in m/s (meters per second). Defaults to 25 when using ``Engine Car``, to 25 when using ``Engine Boat``, or to 100 otherwise.

**Valid_Speed_Horizontal** *float*: Configuring this will override the sanity check for horizontal speed. This value is multiplied by PlayerInput.RATE (0.08), and then squared. Defaults to ``(Speed_Max * 0.125)^2`` when using ``Engine Helicopter`` or ``Engine Blimp``, or to ``(Speed_Max * 0.1)^2`` otherwise. This property is useful for vehicles with speed that the server cannot predict, such as force-applying Unity components.

**Valid_Speed_Up** *float*: Configuring this will override the sanity check for forward speed, in m/s (meters per second). Defaults to 12.5 when using ``Engine Car``, to 3.25 when using ``Engine Boat``, or to 100 otherwise.

**Zip** *flag*: Player character should use a handlebar idle animation.

.. _doc_assets_vehicle:defaultpaintcolors:

**DefaultPaintColors** :ref:`list of colors <doc_data_color>`
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

List of random colors to pick from when spawning a new vehicle. Can be overridden by a :ref:`Vehicle Redirector<doc_asset_vehicle_redirector>`'s :ref:`LoadPaintColor <doc_asset_vehicle_redirector:loadpaintcolor>` and :ref:`LoadPaintColor <doc_asset_vehicle_redirector:spawnpaintcolor>` properties.

Engine RPM and Gears
````````````````````

Cars can opt-in to a somewhat more realistic drive model with an automatic gearbox and engine RPM using these properties.

.. _doc_assets_vehicle:forwardgearratios:

**ForwardGearRatios** :ref:`list of float32 <doc_data_builtin_types>`
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Ratio between engine RPM and wheel RPM in a given gear. For example, if the wheel RPM is 6 and the gear ratio is 5 then the engine RPM is 30.

.. note::

	When converting vanilla cars to gear ratios, the approach I used was to calculate the gear ratio for a desired speed and engine RPM.
	Suppose you're targeting 80 kph with a wheel radius of 0.6 m:

		1. Convert 80 kph to m/s, in this case, 22.2 m/s.
		2. Calculate wheel circumference with 2 * pi * r, in this case 3.77 m.
		3. Calculate how far the vehicle would travel in a minute. 22.2 m/s * 60 s/min is 1,333.2 m/min.
		4. Divide the distance per minute by the circumference to get the wheel RPM of 353.6776.

	Supposedly (I'm still learning as I go) engines work most efficiently around the upper-middle of their RPM range. For example, 3500 RPM for an engine with 1000 idle RPM and 6000 max RPM. Using 3500 as our target engine RPM we can divide it by the wheel RPM to get a good starting point for the gear ratio tuning: 9.89

----

.. _doc_assets_vehicle:reversegearratio:

**ReverseGearRatio** :ref:`float32 <doc_data_builtin_types>` ``1.0``

.. _doc_assets_vehicle:gearshift_downthresholdrpm:

**GearShift_DownThresholdRPM** :ref:`float32 <doc_data_builtin_types>` ``1500.0``
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When engine RPM is below this value and a lower gear is available the car will shift gears down.

----

.. _doc_assets_vehicle:gearshift_upthresholdrpm:

**GearShift_UpThresholdRPM** :ref:`float32 <doc_data_builtin_types>` ``5500.0``
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When engine RPM is above this value and a higher gear is available the car will shift gears up.

----

.. _doc_assets_vehicle:gearshift_duration:

**GearShift_Duration** :ref:`float32 <doc_data_builtin_types>` ``0.5``
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

How long it takes to shift gears, measured in seconds. Wheels do not provide any torque for this duration.

----

.. _doc_assets_vehicle:gearshift_interval:

**GearShift_Interval** :ref:`float32 <doc_data_builtin_types>` ``1.0``
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

How long to wait since the last gear change before shifting gears, measured in seconds. It can take a moment for the engine RPM to adjust after a gear change, so without a delay the RPM would still exceed the threshold.

----

.. _doc_assets_vehicle:engineidlerpm:

**EngineIdleRPM** :ref:`float32 <doc_data_builtin_types>` ``1000.0``
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Engine RPM will never drop below this value regardless of whether wheel RPM * gear ratio is lower. Otherwise, the engine wouldn't be able to start the wheels rolling from zero.

----

.. _doc_assets_vehicle:enginemaxrpm:

**EngineMaxRPM** :ref:`float32 <doc_data_builtin_types>` ``7000.0``
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Engine RPM will never exceed this value regardless of whether wheel RPM * gear ratio is higher. It should be kept to a reasonable value because the normalized engine RPM is used in a variety of places like sampling the torque curve and network replication.

----

.. _doc_assets_vehicle:enginerpm_increaserate:

**EngineRPM_IncreaseRate** :ref:`float32 <doc_data_builtin_types>` ``10000.0``
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

How quickly engine RPM can decrease in RPM/s. For example, 1000 will take 2 seconds to go from 4000 to 2000 RPM.

.. note:: Originally, I thought this might come in handy, but in practice tuning the torque and gear ratios worked better. Kept in case it comes in useful for somebody.

----

.. _doc_assets_vehicle:enginemaxtorque:

**EngineMaxTorque** :ref:`float32 <doc_data_builtin_types>` ``1.0``
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Multiplier for the amount of torque provided to the wheels. Understanding how engine RPM is translated to wheel torque is crucial for tuning the physics:

1. Engine RPM is normalized into a 0 to 1 range according to :ref:`EngineIdleRPM <doc_assets_vehicle:engineidlerpm>` and :ref:`EngineMaxRPM <doc_assets_vehicle:enginemaxrpm>`. For example, an Engine RPM of 2000 with Idle RPM of 1000 and Max RPM of 5000 would be 0.25.
2. Vehicle root needs an ``EngineCurvesComponent`` attached. This allows you to map normalized engine RPM to a normalized torque multiplier. Typically, the multiplier should be closest to 1 in the middle range (e.g., 0.3 to 0.8) and drop off toward 0 and 1.
3. Torque curve is sampled using the normalized engine RPM.
4. Sampled torque is multiplied by ``EngineMaxTorque``.
5. If changing gears, torque is zero.
6. If reversing, torque is multiplied by :ref:`ReverseGearRatio <doc_assets_vehicle:reversegearratio>`.
7. Otherwise, torque is multiplied by the active :ref:`ForwardGearRatio <doc_assets_vehicle:forwardgearratios>`.
8. Each :ref:`Powered Wheel <doc_assets_vehicle:wheelconfiguration_iscolliderpowered>` gets an equal share of the torque. To clarify, the per-wheel torque is equal to the engine output torque divided by the number of powered wheels.

Engine Sound
````````````

**Pitch_Drive** *float*: Multiplier on the pitch of the engine audio while driving. Defaults to 0.03 when using ``Engine Helicopter``, or to 0.1 when using ``Engine Blimp``.

----

**Pitch_Idle** *float*: Multiplier on the pitch of the engine audio while idle. Defaults to 0.625 if the audio clip is named "Engine_Large, or to 0.75 if the audio clip is named "Engine_Small".

----

.. _doc_assets_vehicle:enginesound_type:

**EngineSound_Type** :ref:`enum <doc_data_builtin_types>` ``Legacy`` or ``EngineRPMSimple``
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Defaults to ``Legacy``. In that mode, ``Pitch_Idle`` and ``Pitch_Drive`` are used to control engine audio pitch.

----

**EngineSound** **dictionary**
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When :ref:`EngineSound_Type <doc_assets_vehicle:enginesound_type>` is set to ``EngineRPMSimple`` this should be set to a :ref:`EngineRPMSimple Dictionary <doc_assets_vehicle:enginesound_enginerpmsimple_dictionary>`.

**Speed_Max** *float*: The vehicle's maximum forward speed, in m/s (meters per second). For all ``Engine`` enumerators except for the ``Train`` enumerator, this value is multiplied by 1.25 because the vehicle adjusts wheel torque trying to match a specific speed. For example, a vehicle that uses ``Speed_Max 12.5`` and is using ``Engine Car`` will have a maximum forward speed of 56.25 kph (34.95 mph).

**Steer_Min** *float*: The angle to turn when moving slowly.

.. _doc_assets_vehicle:wheelconfiguration_wheelcolliderpath:

WheelColliderPath :ref:`string <doc_data_builtin_types>`
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Scene hierarchy path of a WheelCollider component relative to the vehicle's root transform.

----

.. _doc_assets_vehicle:wheelconfiguration_iscollidersteered:

IsColliderSteered :ref:`bool <doc_data_builtin_types>` ``false``
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

If true, collider's steering angle responds to player input.

----

.. _doc_assets_vehicle:wheelconfiguration_iscolliderpowered:

IsColliderPowered :ref:`bool <doc_data_builtin_types>` ``false``
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

If true, collider is connected to the engine and responds to player's acceleration input.

----

.. _doc_assets_vehicle:wheelconfiguration_modelpath:

ModelPath :ref:`string <doc_data_builtin_types>`
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Scene hierarchy path of visual representation of wheel relative to the vehicle's root transform.

----

.. _doc_assets_vehicle:wheelconfiguration_ismodelsteered:

IsModelSteered :ref:`bool <doc_data_builtin_types>` ``false``
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

If true, model is rotated according to steering input.

Only kept for backwards compatibility. Prior to wheel configurations, only certain WheelColliders actually received steering input, while multiple models would appear to steer. For example, the APC's front 4 wheels appeared to rotate but only the front 2 actually affected physics.

----

.. _doc_assets_vehicle:wheelconfiguration_modelusecolliderpose:

ModelUseColliderPose :ref:`bool <doc_data_builtin_types>` ``false``
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

If true, model ignores ``IsModelSteered`` and instead uses the wheel collider state (or an approximation when not simulating).

Prior to wheel configurations, some high-fidely modded cars used a separate set of physics constraints to animate the wheel models as if they had suspension. Constraint setups like this should be completely superseded by the ``ModelUseColliderPose`` property. The constraints were awful for performance because physics for every purely-visual wheel were simulated on every client, and even then they didn't actually match the real wheel state.
