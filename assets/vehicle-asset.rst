**Crawler** *flag*: Disables the ``Wheel_#`` GameObjects from turning when steering by setting the default value of ``Num_Steering_Tires`` to 0. This property has no effect if ``Num_Steering_Tires`` has been manually set.

**Drops_Table_ID** *uint16*: ID of the item spawn table to use when the vehicle is destroyed. Defaults to 962.

**Exit** *float*: Distance away from the vehicle to teleport when exiting. Defaults to 2.

**Has_Clip_Prefab** *bool*: Whether or not the vehicle has a Clip.prefab. If the vehicle should use the same prefab on the server as on the client, set to false. For example, most official content uses ``Has_Clip_Prefab false``. Defaults to true.

**Has_Horn** *bool*: Whether or not the vehicle should have a horn. Defaults to true when the vehicle either has a ``Horn`` AudioClip, or the ``HornAudioClip`` property has been set to a valid path. Otherwise, defaults to false.

**IgnitionAudioClip** :ref:`Master Bundle Pointer <doc_data_masterbundleptr>`: AudioClip to play when after entering the driver's seat.

**LockMouse** *flag*: First-person camera movement is locked while driving. This is useful for ``Engine Plane`` and ``Engine Helicopter``, as a player's mouse movement while in first-person can be used to steer the vehicle.

**Num_Steering_Tires** *int32*: Total number of tires that should turn when steering. Defaults to 2 when using ``Engine Car``, to 1 when using any other ``Engine`` enumerator, or to 0 if the ``Crawler`` property has been set.

By default, a number of steering tires equal to the value of ``Num_Steering_Tires`` will be automatically set.

**Valid_Speed_Horizontal** *float*: Configuring this will override the sanity check for horizontal speed. This value is multiplied by PlayerInput.RATE (0.08), and then squared. Defaults to ``(Speed_Max * 0.125)^2`` when using ``Engine Helicopter`` or ``Engine Blimp``, or to ``(Speed_Max * 0.1)^2`` otherwise. This property is useful for vehicles with speed that the server cannot predict, such as force-applying Unity components.

**Valid_Speed_Up** *float*: Configuring this will override the sanity check for forward speed, in m/s (meters per second). Defaults to 12.5 when using ``Engine Car``, to 3.25 when using ``Engine Boat``, or to 100 otherwise.

**Override_Center_Of_Mass** *bool*: If true, override the vehicle's center of mass with the values from the ``Center_Of_Mass_#`` Vector3 properties. This allows for modifying a vehicle's center of gravity without needing to move the ``Cog`` GameObject in Unity.

**Physics_Profile** :ref:`GUID <doc_data_guid>`: GUID of a :ref:`VehiclePhysicsProfileAsset <doc_assets_vehicle_physics_profile>` to use. Using a vehicle physics profile is optional. Defaults to ``47258d0dcad14cb8be26e24c1ef3449e`` when using ``Engine Boat``, to ``6b91a94f01b6472eaca31d9420ec2367`` when using ``Engine Car``, to ``bb9f9f0204c4462ca7d976b87d1336d4`` when using ``Engine Helicopter``, or to ``93a47d6d40454335b4784e803628ac54`` when using ``Engine Plane``.

**Sleds** *flag*: Tires should easily roll. For example, most planes will use this property.

**Speed_Min** *float*: The vehicle's maximum reversing speed, in m/s (meters per second). In-game, a vehicle's speed is displayed as either kph (kilometers per hour) or mph (miles per hour).

**Speed_Max** *float*: The vehicle's maximum forward speed, in m/s (meters per second). For all ``Engine`` enumerators except for the ``Train`` enumerator, this value is multiplied by 1.25 because the vehicle adjusts wheel torque trying to match a specific speed. For example, a vehicle that uses ``Speed_Max 12.5`` and is using ``Engine Car`` will have a maximum forward speed of 56.25 kph (34.95 mph).

**Steer_Min** *float*: The angle to turn when moving slowly.

**Steer_Max** *float*: The angle to turn when moving quickly. This value is multiplied by 0.75.

**Traction** *flag*: Tires should have traction in snowy positions.

**Wheel_Collider_Mass_Override** *float*: Override the mass of the vehicle's Wheel Collider components. This allows for quickly modifying the mass of the wheel colliders without needing to rebundle the asset in Unity. If a vehicle has realistic mass, then it may be helpful to set this value to something exceptionally high (e.g., 500). Defaults to ``null``.

The value specified is the multiplier on the speed a vehicle can go without using a stamina boost. For example, ``Stamina_Boost 0.5`` would only let vehicle move at 50% its maximum speed normally, but using stamina to boost would it reach its maximum speed.
