Farm Assets
===========

Farms (localized as "plants") are a placeable seeds capable of growing into harvestable crops. When a seed is planted, it will grow over time until eventually harvestable. Growing can be finished immediately by either rainfall, or by using a :ref:`growth supplement <doc_item_asset_grower>` on the plant. A fully-grown crop can be harvested, which deals 2 damage to the crop. A crop can be harvested until it has 0 health remaining.

This inherits the :ref:`BarricadeAsset <doc_item_asset_barricade>` class.

.. tip::
