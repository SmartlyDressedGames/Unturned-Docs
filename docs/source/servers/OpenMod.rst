OpenMod
=======

`OpenMod <https://github.com/openmod/openmod>`_ is a spiritual successor to `Rocket <doc_servers_rocket>` developed by one of Rocket's original maintainers. It has its own plugin framework, but supports compatibility with existing Rocket plugins by integrating with RocketMod and LDM.

Installation
------------

Installing OpenMod Using the RocketMod Installer Plugin (recommended)
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

1. Download the latest OpenMod Installer Plugin for RocketMod from the `OpenMod.Installer.RocketMod repository <https://github.com/openmod/OpenMod.Installer.RocketMod/releases/latest>`_.
2. Move it to the ``/Rocket/Plugins`` folder and restart your server.
3. Run ``/openmod install`` and follow the instructions.
4. Done! Now you can `start installing plugins <https://openmod.github.io/openmod-docs/userdoc/concepts/plugins.html>`_.

Installing OpenMod Manually
```````````````````````````
1. Download the latest OpenMod.Unturned.Module-vX.X.X.zip from `openmod repository <https://github.com/openmod/OpenMod/releases/latest>`_.
2. Copy the "OpenMod.Unturned" folder into the "Modules" folder inside the Unturned installation directory.
3. Start your server. The first start will take a while since OpenMod will download its core components.
4. Done! Now you can `start installing plugins <https://openmod.github.io/openmod-docs/userdoc/concepts/plugins.html>`_.

RocketMod Compatibility
```````````````````````

OpenMod can be installed side-by-side with RocketMod, so you can use both RocketMod and OpenMod without any issue. OpenMod does not aim to replace RocketMod but to work with it together instead.
