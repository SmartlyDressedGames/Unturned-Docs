_**NOTICE:** This documentation file has been deprecated, and is no longer receiving updates. It has been superceded in favor of the [ItemAsset directory](/ItemAsset), which contains individual documentation files for each item asset class._

_This deprecated documentation file will be progressively phased out as the new documentation sources are expanded._

__Items__ in _Unturned_ encompass anything that can be carried in a player's in-game inventory. All items share some properties, while each item type has its own unique data. Quick links are available below.

Non-specific Data
=================

* Refer to [README.md](/ItemAsset/README.md).

__Durability__: Either a decimal probability chance of quality loss upon action, or guaranteed loss and durability value is instead representative of the amount lost.
* _Canteens_: Guaranteed quality loss occurs upon drinking. Durability value represents the amount of quality loss.
* _Melee Weapons_: Decimal probability chance of quality loss occurs upon hitting.
* _Ranged Weapons_: Decimal probability chance of quality loss occurs upon shooting.

__Wear__: Increment to degrade quality by. Only applicable to items where durability represents a decimal probability chance of quality loss.

__Structure_Damage__: Damage dealt to structures. Multiplied by 3 in single-player.

__Invulnerable__: Specified if damage ignores structures, barricades, and vehicles that are considered invulnerable to low-power weaponry. Not applicable to explosive damage, which always ignores invulnerability.

__Range__: For ranged and melee weapons – max distance in meters before damage is no longer possible. For explosive weapons (including magazine attachments that generate explosive projectiles) – the radius of the explosion in meters.
