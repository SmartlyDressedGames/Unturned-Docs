Level Asset
===========

Each map can be associated with a **Level Asset**. These assets contain gameplay information not necessary for the main menus. Refer to [Level Config](LevelConfig.md) for information on linking a level asset to a map.

For examples check the `Assets/Levels` directory.

`Dropship` [Master Bundle Pointer](MasterBundlePtr.md): Overrides the model seen flying over the map when a care package is dropped.

`Airdrop` [Asset Pointer](AssetPtr.md): to an [Airdrop Asset](AirdropAsset.md). Overrides the falling care package model.

`Crafting_Blacklists` array of [Asset Pointers](AssetPtr.md) to [Crafting Blacklist(s)](CraftingBlacklistAsset.md). Prevents specific items or blueprints from being used while crafting in the level.

`Min_Stealth_Radius` float: Player stealth skill level cannot reduce minimum detection distance below this value.

`Weather_Types` *array*: determines which weather can occur naturally. Refer to schedulable weather properties. If weather is using legacy weather the default rain and snow will be included.

`Perpetual_Weather_Asset` [Asset Pointer](AssetPtr.md): to a [Weather Asset](WeatherAsset.md). Overrides weather scheduling.

`Global_Weather_Mask` [u32 Mask](Bitmask.md): fallback weather mask while player is not inside an ambience volume. Defaults to 0xFFFFFFFF.

`Skills` *array*: overrides skill default and max levels. Refer to skill rule properties.

`Enable_Admin_Faster_Salvage_Duration` *bool*: by default players in singleplayer and admins in multiplayer have a faster salvage time.

`Has_Clouds` *bool*: disables clouds in skybox when false. Defaults to true.

`Loading_Screen_Music` *array*: randomly selected. Refer to music properties.

`Should_Animate_Background_Image` *bool*: if true, the background image moves left/right with loading progress. Defaults to false because maps have important information on the loading screen.

This is an [Asset v2](AssetsV2.md) class.
