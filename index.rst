Unturned Documentation
======================

Welcome to the official documentation for `Unturned <https://store.steampowered.com/app/304930>`_'s modding and server hosting features! To navigate, use the table of contents in the sidebar or the search function in the top-left corner.

A lot of our older documentation was scattered between YouTube videos and Steam Guides. The main Steam Guide with links to related guides can be found here: `Workshop: Creating, Publishing & Updating <https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=460136012>`_. Note that most of these older guides are outdated.

Upcoming Features
-----------------

You can find modding features under consideration on this Trello board: `Unturned Roadmap <https://trello.com/b/gpe4zlW3/unturned-roadmap>`_. The cards on the board aren't ordered in any particular way. i.e., they do not dictate the order of updates.

Miscellaneous requests and tasks that may pop up take priority over the roadmap, so it may go a while between progress updates. For example, work for curated maps often takes priority. Several high-priority ideas that don't yet have a solid plan, like a crafting revamp, aren't listed on the board.

Video Tutorials
---------------

`How to host a Dedicated Server on Windows <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8axVrnSLlx4>`_
